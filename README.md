# Mini web CV

This **_Mini web CV_** I does using bootstrap can be used by everyone who would like to do the same design.
Here's a [Preview](https://titouangalvani-mini-cv.netlify.com/) of what it looks like whith my informations.
It is a very small project so even **_beginners_** (as I'm a student myself) should be able to understand everything and use it as they want.

Feel free to **clone** the project with : `git clone https://github.com/ImMyst/Mini-CV.git`

And delete my **_ugly face_**, **_name_** and **_profil_** from the page.

**_Personalize it_**, **_DON'T_** copy it and leave it the same, or I will ask for :euro: :wink:.
