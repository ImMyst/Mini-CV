# Mini web CV

This **_Mini web CV_** I does using Bootstrap can be used by everyone who would like to do the same design.
Here's a *[Preview](https://titouangalvani-mini-cv.netlify.com/)* of what it looks like whith my informations.
It is a very small project so even **beginners** (as I'm a student myself) should be able to understand everything and use it as they want.

* Feel free to **clone** the project with : `git clone https://github.com/ImMyst/Mini-CV.git`
* Adding dependencies with `npm i`
* Compiling assets with `npm run start`
* :tada: Enjoy ! :tada:

And delete my **ugly face**, **name** and **profil** from the page.

**_Personalize it_**, **DON'T** copy it and leave it the same, or I will ask for 💶 of course 😉.
