# Mini web CV

This **_mini web CV_** I does using bootstrap can be used by everyone who would like to do the same design.
It is a very small project so even *beginners* should be able to understand everything.

Feel free to **clone** the project with : `git clone https://github.com/ImMyst/Mini-CV.git`

And delete my *ugly face*, *name* and *profil* from the page.

**_Personalize it_**, don't copy it and leave it the same.
